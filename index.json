Training Data already has the value, which our Function should predict for a new, strange input. i.e, In the case below, we want to get a function, so that we can calculate the price of a house to be sold. We have 4 Training Data in this table and each Data has 4 Features that have a influence on its' price ( we call it as Multi-Features. It’ll be discussed later:) ).

We can derive structure from data where we don’t necessarily know the effect of the variables.

In a regression problem, we are trying to predict results within a continuous output, meaning that we are trying to map input variables to some continuous function. Classification: As its' name, we want to devide the input in different classes. i.g., After training, with the help of the color, weight, outlook and smel ( Features ), we want to predict if the coffee beans we have come from Arabica or Robusta. In a classification problem, we are instead trying to predict results in a discrete output. In other words, we are trying to map input variables into discrete categories.

Its' value has influence on the speed, how fast we can find the parameters, with that we can reach a local optimal value. When $\\alpha$ too large / too small is: too large: we might miss the parameters, which can help us get the local optimal value. too small: We need more iterations ( Baby Steps / more time ). We can make the judge, whether $\\alpha$ too large / small ist by drawing the plot of iterations - $J(\\theta_0, \\theta_1)$: It should be lower. Otherwise is $\\alpha$ too large. We can start $\\alpha$ from 0.001, …, 0.01, …, 0.1. And Andrew Ng advises us to use 3 times ( 0.001, 0.003, 0.01, 0.03, 0.1 ) to try it.
